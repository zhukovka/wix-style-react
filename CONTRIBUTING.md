Thanks for contributing. We're happy for your input and would ask you to follow this contribution guide to maintain a high quality code.

## Getting Started

Let's get the storybook running locally
```
npm start
```
If you run it for the first time, it will build and run `npm run storybook`.
(This initial build is necessary for creating `new-icons` proxy, after that, you my just run `npm run storybook`)
