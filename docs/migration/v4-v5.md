# Upgrading `wix-style-react` from v4.0.0 to v5.0.0

### `<Heading/>`
Typography styles and semantics were changed.

#### Needed action `TL;DR`

You should change the `appearance` values according to these rules:

- `H2` --> `H3`
- `H3` --> `H5`
- `H4` --> `H6`

[See the full migration doc here](../../src/Heading/MIGRATION.md)
### `<Checkbox/>`

prop `active` was removed, please use `checked` instead

```diff
-<Checkbox active/>
+<Checkbox checked/>
```

---

value `large` for prop `size` was removed, please use `medium`.

```diff
-<Checkbox size="large"/>
+<Checkbox size="medium"/>
```

### `<Icons/>`

Old icons were deprecated for a long time and are no longer available. Consult [migration doc here](./NEW_ICONS_MIGRATION.md)

### `<Button/>`

A temporary `withNewIcons` prop was removed, it is now the default.

```diff
-<Button withNewIcons/>
+<Button/>
```


### `<LanguagePicker/>`

This component was deprecated for a long time and is no longer
available. Instead of `<LanguagePicker/>` please use `<IconWithOptions/>`

### `<SideBar/>`

For a long time this component was undershadowed by `<SideMenu/>`.
`wix-style-react@5.0.0` no longer provides `<SideBar/>` please instead
use `<SideMenu/>`

### Grid

1. Alongside `<Row/>` & `<Col/>` grid also used to export `Card`. Please
   import `Card` separately:

    ```diff
    -import {Row, Col, Card} from 'wix-style-react/Grid'
    +import {Row, Col} from 'wix-style-react/Grid'
    +import Card from 'wix-style-react/Card'
    ```

2. `<Row/>` & `<Col/>` components had the following css:
    ```css
    > * { box-sizing: border-box; }
    ```

    it meant that all child components would receive such `box-sizing`
    which was not always desired.

    since `wix-style-react@5.0.0` css was changed to:
    ```css
    .row,
    .col { box-sizing: border-box; }
    ```

    This now means that only `<Row/>` and `<Col/>` have this but none of
    this children.

    It should not be a breaking change but it's worth mentioning because
    some projects may have `box-sizing` overwritten.
