# Calendar Spec

| propName | propType | defaultValue | isRequired | description |
|----------|----------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| selectedDays | Date \| `{from: Date, to: Date}` | | | Day / Range that should appear as selected.|
| onSelectedDaysChange | func | | Yes | Called when selectedDays changes by user interaction. When `selectionMode=day`, the function receives a Date object. When `selectionMode=range`, the function receives an Range object of the form `{from: Date, to: Date}`.|
| selectionMode | 'day' \| 'range' | 'day' |  | Affects the click behavior and how it selects a day or a range |
| month | Date | | | The month to display in the calendar. This differs from the initialMonth prop, as it causes the calendar to re-render when its value changes. |
| onMonthCahnged | func |  | | Event handler when the month is changed. Function receives a Date object. |


## Selection
There are the following modes:
- `day` (single day) - a single click selects a day

- `range` (single range)

| `from` | `to` | click |
|------|----|-------|
| -    |  - |  Sets `from` date |
| exists   |  - |  Sets `to` date |
| exists    |  exists |  resets the range and sets the `from` date | 

## Selection Range Hover (Styling)
| `from` | `to` | hover |
|------|----|-------|
| -    |  - |  Shows a day hover style |
| exists   |  - |  Shows a range hover style, as if the hover-day is the `to` date. If the hover is before `from` date, then it would show styles as if `from` is the `to` date, and the hover-date is the `from` date. |
| exists    |  exists |  Shows a day hover style |

### Keyboard Navigation
Same hover logic applies to focus-day, when navigating through days via keyboard.
