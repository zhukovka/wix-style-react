## Adding a new Icon

* Add the new SVG file to the src/Icons/raw folder. Use a descriptive name since it'll be used as the React component name.
* Run `npm run build`
* You can now import your icon by name from the `wix-style-react/src/Icons/dist` folder!

**Notice that during `npm run build` the SVG files go through various optimizations hence it is recommended to validate the outcome of the icons in storybook (`npm start` and navigate to Icons)!**
